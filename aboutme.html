    <div class="soccer">
        <h2>Soccer Passion</h2>
        <p class="p">Soccer has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. I’ve been playing since I was
            a kid, and it’s more than just a sport to me—it’s a way to stay active, push myself, and connect with
            others. I'm a huge fan of Real Madrid and Atlético Nacional, and whether I’m on the field or watching a
            match, the passion never fades. The discipline, strategy, and teamwork in football inspire me both
            personally and professionally. It’s not just a hobby—it’s part of who I am.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hobbies">
        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p class="p">Outside of my professional life, I stay inspired through a variety of hobbies that keep my mind
            sharp and my creativity flowing. Music plays a big role in my daily routine—whether I’m discovering new
            artists or curating playlists, it keeps me focused and energized. Music has become a part of me, for
            everything I need to be listening to music. Staying active is also important to me, whether it's hitting the
            gym, going for a run, or just spending time outdoors. In my downtime, I like watching films or diving into a
            good series like Peaky Blinders.</p>

    <div class="dream">
        <h2>Biggest Dream</h2>
        <p class="p">I’ve always had a special interest in the UK—not just as a place to visit, but as somewhere I can
            truly see myself living. The culture, the lifestyle, the mix of tradition and modern life... it just speaks
            to me. My dream is to travel there, explore everything it has to offer, and eventually make it my home. I
            imagine building a life there, growing personally and professionally, and waking up every day feeling like
            I’m exactly where I’m meant to be. It’s a goal that keeps me motivated, and step by step, I’m moving closer
            to making it real.</p>
