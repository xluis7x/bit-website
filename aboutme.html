                <p>Soccer is a part of me. I’ve been playing since I was
                    a kid, and it’s more than just a sport to me, it's a way of feeling alive, I get excited to play or just watch a game, it's a unique feeling. I'm a huge fan of Real Madrid and Atlético Nacional, and whether I’m on the field or watching
                    a match, the passion never fades. The discipline, strategy, and teamwork in football inspire me to become better every day. </p>

                <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. It helps me focus, whether I’m working or just chilling, there’s always something playing in the background.  One artist who really speaks to me is Jhayco. His style and creativity hit different. From his lyrics to his vibe, he’s been a big influence on the way I connect with music. Whether it's something chill or something to hype me up, Jhayco’s tracks are always on repeat. </p>
