                <h2 class="lighth">Soccer Passion</h2>
                <p>Soccer is a part of me. I’ve been playing since I was
                    a kid, and it’s more than just a sport to me, it's a way of feeling alive, I get excited to play or
                    just watch a game, it's a unique feeling. I'm a huge fan of Real Madrid and Atlético Nacional, and
                    whether I’m on the field or watching
                    a match, the passion never fades. The discipline, strategy, and teamwork in football inspire me to
                    become better every day. </p>

                <h2 class="lighth">Music Passion</h2>
                <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. It helps me focus, whether I’m working or just
                    chilling, there’s always something playing in the background. One artist who really speaks to me is
                    Jhayco. His style and creativity hit different. From his lyrics to his vibe, he’s been a big
                    influence on the way I connect with music. Whether it's something chill or something to hype me up,
                    Jhayco’s tracks are always on repeat. </p>

                    <dt><strong>Peaky Blinders</dt></strong>
                    <dd>The best mafia series I have seen in my entire life and of course it's my favorite. ever since I
                        saw this series I have always wanted to travel to England and one day be able to make my life
                        there.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Outer Banks</dt></strong>
                    <dd>A very entertaining series, the story, the characters and everything is amazing, in my opinion
                        one of the best series for teenagers, perfect to watch with your friends. Also my second
                        favorite series.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Maze Runner</dt></strong>
                    <dd>It's not a series but a saga of incredible films, each film is very good, the perfect saga to
                        watch on that movie night with some pop corn.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Hunger Games</dt></strong>
                    <dd>A classic, but it never fails, this film saga is one of my favorites, all the films are made
                        with very good special effects and everything is too good. </dd>
                    <dt><strong>A good girl's guide to murder</dt></strong>
                    <dd>This is a very good series, I recommend it, especially if you like to think a lot about the
                        reason or the curious "why" of things, this is perfect for you.</dd>
